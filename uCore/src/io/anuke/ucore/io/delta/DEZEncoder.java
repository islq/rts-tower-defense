/**
 * 'DeltaZ-1' format encoder.
 * <p>
 * Encoder for very simple binary delta format.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Header</h3>
 * <pre>
 *  magic: 'D' 'E' 'Z' '1'
 *  flags: one byte
 *  source size: one integer
 *  target size: one integer
 *  instructions follow directly
 *  ?? no epilogue defined ??
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Integers are encoded as a compacted big-endian sequence
 * with 7 bits per byte. Leading zero septets are discarded.
 * The MSB of each byte is a continue bit which indicates
 * another 7 bits are to be read.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Instruction stream</h3>
 * <pre>
 * x0000000                     - reserved
 * 00XXXXXX CAAAAAAA*           - copy + 6 bit length + address
 * 10XXXXXX CXXXXXXX* CAAAAAAA* - copy + extended length + address
 * 010XXXXX DDDDDDDD*           - add + 5 bit length - 1 + sequence
 * 110XXXXX CXXXXXXX* DDDDDDDD* - add + extended length - 1 + sequence
 * 011XXXXX RRRRRRRR            - run + 5 bit count - 1 + byte
 * 111XXXXX CXXXXXXX* RRRRRRRR  - run + extended count - 1 + byte
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Opcodes include a length encoded as an integer.
 * <dl>
 * <dt>COPY
 * <dd>The opcode/length followed by an absolute address of the source of
 * the copy. COPY is decodeable directly as an integer. A length of 0 is reserved.
 * <p>
 * The address covers the range of the source buffer concatenated with as much
 * of the target buffer as has currently been decoded. The address+length will
 * not span buffers.
 * <dt>ADD
 * <dd>The opcode/length followed by (length+1) bytes of data
 * to copy to the current output location.
 * <dt>RUN
 * <dd>The opcode/length followed by a byte to be duplicated
 * into the current output stream (length+1) times.
 * </dl>
